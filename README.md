# About

I created this portfolio site using React and SASS. The user can view different portfolio items based on how those items are "tagged." Portfolio items are stored in the portfolioData.json file. Each item has a key "tags". The site generates tag buttons based on the unique set of these tags from the portfolioData.json file. If you were to add a new tag to an item, such as "Angular", the site will generate an "Angular" button. This way, the user can easily filter portfolio items based on their tags.

If you would like to use this site as a template for your own, please just fork and give me credit by linking to this page! :)
